## *18/01/2022*

Objective of the day :
- Make the test plan 🟢
- Do the first run 🟢
- Put first run bugs in tracker 🟢

### Make the test plan
Each website functionalities seen had been put in the test plan.
We detected "logical" uses and created the appropriate tests

### Do the first run
First run had been executed.
Result had been written down on the excel.
We found lot of bugs.

### Put first run bugs in tracker
Bugs had been reported to the bug tracker

### Conclusion
Lot of bugs had been founded.
Some of them are minor (syntax) but the others are pretty criticals (stack trace, wrong redirects)

## *26/01/2022*

Objective of the day :
- Run the test plan for the second time 🟢
- Put second run bugs in tracker & update olders 🟢
- Automate the tests 🟠

### Run the test plan for the second time
We ran the test plan on the version **1.0.2** of the website to look for patched bugs.

### Put second run bugs in tracker & update olders
We updated the status of the current reported bugs and added the new ones.

### Automate the tests
We setup playwright and started to automate tests.
We already have at least one test working.

### Conclusion
Still some bugs to fix on the next version.
Playwright is working well. We need to continue to automate tests.
